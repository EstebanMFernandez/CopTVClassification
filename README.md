Cop TV Classification
This repository contains R scripts for classifying transcripts from police TV shows using OpenAI's GPT API. The project analyzes patterns in how police and law enforcement are portrayed across various TV series.

üìñ Overview
The analysis focuses on identifying positive and negative depictions of law enforcement, leveraging machine learning-based text classification. It includes:

Text classification via OpenAI's GPT API
Factor analysis and dimensionality reduction
Time-series analysis of portrayals over time
Data visualization using ggplot2
üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/EstebanMFernandez/CopTVClassification.git
cd CopTVClassification

Install Required R Packages:
install.packages(c("httr", "jsonlite", "ggplot2", "psych", "dplyr", "stringr", "openxlsx"))

API Key Setup (Environment Variable):
To run the classification, you need an OpenAI API key.

Open or create an .Renviron file in your home directory:
file.edit("~/.Renviron")

Add this line (replace with your actual key):
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here

Save and restart RStudio.

üöÄ Usage
The primary script is GPTCopClassify112624.R, which processes and classifies transcripts.

Run the Analysis:
source("GPTCopClassify112624.R")

Expected Outputs:
Classification labels for each transcript (e.g., positive/negative portrayal).
Factor analysis results for thematic trends.
Time-series plots illustrating changes over time.
üìä Methodology
The project uses the OpenAI GPT API to classify text passages from police TV shows. The classification focuses on valence (positive/negative portrayals) and is validated through manual coding checks and factor analysis.

Key Analytical Steps:

Preprocessing: Cleaning transcripts (stopwords, punctuation removal).
Classification: GPT API for labeling sentences based on sentiment/valence.
Analysis: Factor analysis to identify underlying portrayal patterns.
Visualization: Time-series analysis to track changes across years.
üîç Sample Insights
The classification reveals trends in how police portrayals shift across different TV shows and time periods, highlighting patterns such as increased positive portrayals during certain cultural moments.

‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notice
API keys are handled via environment variables. Please do not hardcode your key into the script.
